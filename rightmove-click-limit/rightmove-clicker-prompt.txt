I want to create a Chrome extension called 'Rightmove Click Limiter' that limits browsing on the Rightmove website to 50 clicks every 24 hours. The extension should:

Track the number of clicks on the Rightmove website and decrement by one for each click.
When the 50-click limit is reached, it should display a full-screen overlay with a warning message and a 'Continue Anyway' button.
Prevent the page from loading any further until 'Continue Anyway' is clicked.
Display the remaining clicks in a popup window with a reset button, which resets the count to 50.
Please provide all code files required, including manifest.json, popup.html, content.js, background.js, and any necessary images (use a placeholder image like 'warning.gif' and 'house.png' as the icon). Also, include instructions for loading this extension into Chrome, assuming I donâ€™t have JavaScript knowledge.
