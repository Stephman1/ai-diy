## What did you build in this episode?

In episode 2, I built a break reminder desktop application with ChatGPT that reminds me to take take short breaks every few hours while working and studying. This encourages me to get some fresh air or make a cup of coffee to avoid the negative effects of sitting in front of a computer screen all day.
